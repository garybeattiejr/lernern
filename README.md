Hello!

Gary B here, I am just polishing up on my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills. I hope to develop and code great experiences for people all around the world. Design is my forte, so I am looking forward to challenging myself on building great apps that translate into great experiences. I am pushing to post up new tidbits of tutorials, work, snippets and more everyday. Thanks for stopping by!
